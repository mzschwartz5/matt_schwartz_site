    In 2015, I matriculated at Rice University with a love for outer space and a plan to study astrophysics. Rice's physics department did not disappoint, but over the course of several research experiences, I found that I didn't enjoy academia. This wasn't the sort of scientific discovery I was hoping to make, to say the least! Still deeply interested in physics, however, I decided to change course slightly and pursue a degree in computational physics - a more applied side of the discipline, which strives to use computer science and applied mathematics to simulate physics phenomena. In 2019, I graduated with a BS in computational physics, and a minor in applied mathematics, with a 3.88 GPA.

    After graduating, I started work at Epic Systems as a software developer, creating a suite of healthcare products used by over 250 million patients worldwide. I wore many hats at Epic - most often as a backend engineer developing a set of RESTful APIs used to exchange healthcare data with third parties in the standard HL7 FHIR format. I also, however, helped build the App Orchard website, a marketplace for healthcare apps to advertise their products and test our APIs. And, as time permitted, I occasionally built the handy internal tool, often spurred by a personal desire to automate tedious workflows or to better visualize data.

    I currently work at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a backend engineer on the ASAP team. We own a service responsible for automating security patching of the millions of hosts at Amazon, as well as deploying other updates such as OS migrations and host replacements. Working at AWS has taught me a lot about building and supporting scalable distributed services - from certain pitfalls of distributed components to the importance of good monitoring systems (alarms, metrics, logs) and more. One of my most important contributions in getting our service to production was the design and execution of a battery of load tests. Given the prohibitive cost of provisioning tens of thousands of hosts to tests on, I developed end-to-end tests which instead simulated those hosts and emulated their behavior as if in a real patching run. When executed, these tests revealed a large number of issues - from race conditions and throttling issues to more mundane infrastructure and configuration issues. I'm proud to say that we to resolved each of these issues in turn and rolled out our service with a much greater confidence in its ability to handle production-level load, and we maintain that confidence with each update to our code by running the load tests (scaled down) in our CI/CD pipeline.

    In my spare time, I enjoy learning about computer graphics and creating video games. This began in college, when I recreated a card game called Morels in a virtual, online format, so I could continue to play with friends and family. This proved to be quite a challenge for me, consuming my spare time for two semesters while I studied the Unity framework and fundamentals of networking and server-client architecture. Naturally, by the time I finished, the company that owns Morels had released a sleek mobile app of the game! Nonetheless, it was a learning experience for me and a new hobby. I occasionally participate in game jams, most recently creating a game called Jewel3d, which is the 3D successor to the classic game Bejeweled. And I also tinker around making shaders and 3D models in Blender. You can see Morels, Jewel3d, and other projects from my collegiate and professional experiences in the Projects tab.

    The writing is on the wall! As I've put down my roots in Philadelphia, my place of work has decided to force its employees to relocate (in my case, across the country). I'm now looking for new opportunities - either using my existing skill set in backend software engineering and distributed systems, or exploring my passion for computer graphics. Shortly, I'll be starting a masters' program at University of Pennsylvania in Computer Graphics and Game Technology, part time. And, hopefully, I'll find a full-time job to occupy the rest of my time, before I'm forced to jump ship at AWS. If you or anyone you know is looking for a Philadelphia-based software engineer, please get in touch!
    
    Congrats for reaching the bottom of the page! There's no reward for making it this far, but you did it anyway!
