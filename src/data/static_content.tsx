    Hi, I'm Matt Schwartz! I'm a software engineer with nearly five years of industry experience, now working on obtaining my master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania in Computer Graphics and Game Technology. I have experience designing and implementing scalable distributed systems at AWS, and full-stack and web-development experience working on the App Orchard marketplace and API at Epic Systems. Before entering industry, my education was primarily in computational physics and applied mathematics. Now, I'm looking to combine my passions for computer science, physics, and art at what I feel to be their natural intersection point: computer graphics.

    In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, cycling and staying healthy, playing card and board games, spending time with my family, and pretending a youtube binge is somehow a better use of time than just watching a full-length movie!

    As of August 2024, I am currently a full time master's student at UPenn studying Computer Graphics in the CGGT program, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. My passion for computer graphics reaches back over 6 years to my undergraduate degree, when I set out in Unity to create an online version of a card game called Morels. Though my skills at the time were still blossoming, I proudly achieved my goal of creating a fully-functional networked game which I could play with friends and family. A few game jams later, I started to crave a deeper understanding of shaders and the graphics pipeline. Stumbling upon procedural landscapes by Inigo Quilez, I fell in love with the unique blend of math and art involved, and the rest is history! After a couple part-time semesters at UPenn while working full-time at AWS, I've finally committed to finishing the degree as a full-time student, and am excited to apply my newly-acquired skills in the industry soon.

    Before enrolling full-time at UPenn, I worked at Amazon Web Services as a backend engineer on the ASAP team. ASAP owns a service responsible for automating security patching of the millions of hosts at Amazon, as well as deploying other updates such as OS migrations and host replacements. In my role there, I became proficient at building and supporting distributed services - from designing fault-tolerant infrastructure to proactively monitoring our systems (via alarms, metrics, and logs), and more. One of my most important contributions in getting our service to production was the design and execution of a battery of load tests. Given the prohibitive cost of provisioning tens of thousands of hosts to test on, I instead developed tests which simulated those hosts and emulated their behavior as if participating in a real patching deployment. When executed, these tests revealed a large number of issues - from race conditions and throttling to more mundane infrastructure and configuration bugs. After resolving each of these problems in turn, I'm proud to say that we rolled out our service with a much greater confidence in its ability to handle production-level load. Moreover we maintained that confidence with each update to our code by automatically rerunning the load tests as a part of our CI/CD pipelines.

    I entered the industry in 2019 at Epic Systems as a software developer, helping to create a suite of healthcare products used by over 250 million patients worldwide. I wore many hats at Epic - most often, my backend engineer hat, developing a set of RESTful APIs used to exchange healthcare data with third parties using the standard HL7 FHIR format. I also worked extensively on the App Orchard website, a marketplace for healthcare apps to advertise their products and test our APIs in sandboxed environments. (The skills I picked up doing so enabled me to build the page you're reading right now - my very own React-and-Firebase website!) And, as time permitted, I occasionally built a handy internal tool, often spurred by a personal desire to automate tedious workflows or to better visualize performance data.

    Starting off the journey, I matriculated at Rice University in 2015 with a love for outer space and a plan to study astrophysics. Rice's physics department lived up to its amazing reputation, but over the course of several research experiences, I found that I didn't enjoy the pace and (often) abstract nature of academic research. This wasn't the sort of scientific discovery I was hoping to make, to say the least! Still deeply interested in physics, however, I changed trajectory and pursued a degree in computational physics - a more applied side of the discipline, which strives to use computer science and applied mathematics to simulate physical phenomena. This ended up being a great decision and would eventually lead me to my passion for computer graphics. In 2019, I graduated with a BS in computational physics, and a minor in applied mathematics, with a 3.88 GPA.
