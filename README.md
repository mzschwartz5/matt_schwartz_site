My personal website and blog - built from the ground up!

Made using React for the frontend and Firebase as a backend. Also uses Material-UI for some components. 

Contents:
1. Home page - a timeline-style presentation about myself and my background.
2. Projects - a gallery of projects that I've worked on (with links to source code or demos, where applicable).
3. Blog - blogs about my progress on projects. As of writing, this section is sparse but growing! I'm working on a series explaining
the details of how I constructed this site. Next, I plan to build a physics engine from scratch and blog about that!
